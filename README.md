# 🐍 Python Tutorial — Workbook Series

This repository showcases my Python learning journey through a series of structured workbooks, each focusing on key programming concepts and applied exercises. The workbooks were developed to strengthen my understanding of fundamental and intermediate Python skills — from syntax and debugging to object-oriented programming.

---

## 📘 Workbook 1 — *Basics of Python*
This workbook focuses on the foundational concepts of Python programming.  
Each exercise contained intentional coding errors that were fixed and explained.  
It covers:
- Identifying and correcting syntax and logic errors  
- Variables, expressions, and statements  
- Conditional execution  
- Functions and basic program structure  

**Purpose:** Build a strong foundation in debugging and logical problem-solving.

---

## 📗 Workbook 2 — *Strings and File Handling*
This section introduces string manipulation and file operations.  
The main exercises involve:
- Processing and parsing text files  
- Extracting and computing values from specific patterns (e.g., spam confidence values)  
- Performing average calculations and simple data analysis  

**Purpose:** Strengthen text handling and file-reading skills essential for data processing.

---

## 📙 Workbook 3 — *Dictionaries and Text Processing*
This workbook emphasizes data structures and parsing techniques.  
The exercises focus on:
- Creating and managing dictionaries  
- Iterating through key-value pairs  
- Splitting strings into word lists  
- Parsing and analyzing email data for timestamps and content  

**Purpose:** Learn to represent, count, and organize data using dictionaries and loops.

---

## 📒 Workbook 4 — *Python Objects and OOP Concepts*
This final workbook explores object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.  
It covers:
- Understanding classes, objects, and instances  
- Differentiating methods from functions, and attributes from variables  
- Comparing procedural and object-oriented paradigms  
- Discussing the advantages of using classes for modular code design  

**Purpose:** Transition from procedural programming to object-oriented thinking for better code structure and reusability.

## 📁 Repository Structure
Each workbook is organized into separate folders, with exercises and notebooks grouped by chapter:
- **Workbook 1:** Basic Syntax and Debugging  
- **Workbook 2:** Strings and File Handling  
- **Workbook 3:** Dictionaries and Text Parsing  
- **Workbook 4:** Object-Oriented Programming
